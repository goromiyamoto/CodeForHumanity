# Java Code
This code has about 200 lines of code. Some variables defined in the beginning (c1n1, c1n2, etc). Which I'll remove someday.
It does the 21 cards Magic trick, which is purely math-based.
It shuffles 2 times the cards, as the first one is the same (lazy to do it with random values), based in a 1-2-3 shuffle.
1-2-3 shuffle, in this Magic Trick, is getting any of the non-selected lines, put the selected one in the middle, and the other that wasn't
picked up last (the first and third one doesn't matter, only the chosen one NEEDS to be in the middle).
It does this 2 times, then I've selected the 4th letter in the last selected line.
